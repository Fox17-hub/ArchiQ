## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- go through several, yet  distinct, UI/UX patterns  

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- pure JS
- [Splide](https://splidejs.com) - Typescript library
- [GLaDOS Voice Generator](https://glados.c-net.org) - Text-to-Speech engine


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

#### If I had to do it all over again
I would start with optimizing images. As I've recently learned to use Chrome's Lighthouse, I would correct every img size to improve overall performances.

### Continued development

I consider this project done as the scope of technical practice is limited compared to what I've learned since. The only major improvment will be code refactoring as I started this project way before I started my Fullstack JS bootcamp and this will be an amazing exercice about working on junior legacy code.
