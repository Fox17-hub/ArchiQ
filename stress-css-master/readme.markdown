CSS Stress Test
---------------

This project is a bookmarklet for stress testing the CSS on any given webpage.  
It indexes all the elements and their classes, and then--class by class--it 
removes one, and times how long it takes to scroll the page.  Selectors that 
save a considerable amount of time when removed indicate problem areas.

To install the bookmarklet, visit my blog post on this project: <http://andy.edinborough.org/CSS-Stress-Testing-and-Performance-Profiling>
