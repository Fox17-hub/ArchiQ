# Arch-iQ

Arch-iQ will always hold a special place in my heart. This was my first web project ! I started it a month prior joining the O'clock school, to have remember the HTML and CSS I learned years ago, to give a first go at Javascript, to see if that career path would suit me. And it was way more fun than expected.
